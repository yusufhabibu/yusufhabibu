## 💼 About Me

I graduated with a B.Sc. in Petroleum & Gas Engineering (Second Class Upper) from the University of Lagos, ranking among the top 12 in my class. With a background in engineering economics, petroleum economics, and data science, I bridge the gap between technical analysis and strategic decision-making. I am driven by a deep interest in machine learning applications for sustainable energy systems and economic growth across Africa.
